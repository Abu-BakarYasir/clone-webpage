                Hi, my name is José, and I am Beautiful Brain's founder.<br><br>
                I live in Porto, Portugal, with my wife and toddler son, after having lived and worked across four continents and visited more than 50 countries.<br><br>
                I have worked in tech and product management for the past 10 years and started a new journey as independent in 2022.

        <h2 style="font-family:Recoleta Bold, serif; font-size:40px;">
            For the past eleven years, my wife has called me <br>the "Beautiful Brain."

                My wife would call me that because she noticed I have a different way of thinking that could solve problems in a unique way.

            <p>
                This was also a common way co-workers and managers described my skills, but I only started understanding why I was like that in my 30s. Despite those compliments, I always felt like I was underachieving because I would quickly lose interest when an idea would lose novelty.<br><br>
                After a major depression episode, and thanks to the help of therapy, I discovered that I had ADHD. This made me reflect and understand who I am, both reflecting myself and by asking for help from others.

        <div class="p1">
            <p>
                I decided to break free from traditional corporate life and establish my path. I want to take control of my life to focus on my well-being first and foremost.<br><br>
                I learned that my value is not being an expert in a narrow field but rather my ability to bring a different perspective to any problem. Therefore, I read and learn daily about a variety of topics (politics, economics, and biology, among others) because I think that will help me become an overall thinker.<br><br>
            </p>
            <h4 style="font-family:Recoleta Bold; font-size: 20px;">
                It took me 2+ years to break free from the norm, focus on what I value, and live a more authentic self. Now I want to help others.

            <h1>Diversity</h1>
            <p>Each individual is different and must first understand themselves to achieve their highest potential. Diverse teams allow us to capture the best of us all.</p>

            <h1>Lifelong Learning</h1>
            <p>To stay relevant, you need to always be learning. I always aspire to keep a growth mindset and spend at least 20% of my time learning new things.</p>

            <h1>Stoicism</h1>
            <p>Hedonic adaptation is real, so it is important to avoid the urge to get new things. I try to constantly remind myself of that and focus on experiences over stuff.</p>

            <h1>Flexibility</h1>
            <p>People do their best work if they can work where they perform the best. I believe remote and async will be the future of work and will allow more people to do their best work.</p>
